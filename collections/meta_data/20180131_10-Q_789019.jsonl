Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard depends on contract-specific terms and in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing.

We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments.

The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets and liabilities primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities."}

The TCJA requires us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5 for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8 on the remaining income. The TCJA also reduces the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal year 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate is 28 . This is the result of using the tax rate of 35 for the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21 for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The TCJA includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income GILTI of foreign subsidiaries and a base erosion anti-abuse tax BEAT measure that taxes certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its subsidiaries. The GILTI and BEAT provisions of the TCJA will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018."}

During the quarter, we recorded a provisional net charge based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. The provisional net charge is subject to revisions as we complete our analysis of the TCJA, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service IRS ), FASB, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. Adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. Our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. The impacts of our estimates are described further below."}

Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed.

The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect.

Our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries."}
