# Retriever-Reader pipeline

# Important Note on Directory Structure
Maintain the directory structure as defined in `config.py`. It should properly linked to the collections and indexes on my home directory. 

# Note
Given that the raw 10-K files contain duplicate IDs, the utility function `retrieve_paragraph_from_docid` might return the wrong paragraph.
